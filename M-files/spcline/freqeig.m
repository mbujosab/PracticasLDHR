%FREQEIG	Evaluate eigen-based spectral estimate.
%	[h,f] = FREQEIG(A,M,FS) evaluates the frequency
%	response of a spectral estimate in the form
%
%		Q = w' P w
%
%	where w = [1 exp(jw) exp(j2w) ... exp(j(N-1)w]'
%	and P is a symmetric matrix.  The
%	algorithm exploits of the conjugate symmetric
%	property of the resulting polynomial to compute
%	the frequency response using a single FFT of
%	size M.
%
%	If the sampling frequency, FS, is not given, the
%	vector F is returned such that 1 equals the Nyquist
%	frequency.

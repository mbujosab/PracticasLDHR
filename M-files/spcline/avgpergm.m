function [y,var] = avgpergm(x,nfft,arg3,arg4,arg5)
%AVGPERGM Average periodogram.
%	[X,VAR] = AVGPERGM(x) computes the average, non-overlap-
%	ping periodogram (Bartlett procedure) of x, the magnitude
%	is returned in X and the variance in VAR
%
%	[X,VAR] = AVGPERGM(x,NFFT) sets the FFT length to NFFT.
%
%	[X,VAR] = AVGPERGM(x,NFFT,WINDOW) uses the data smoothing
%	WINDOW.  The length of WINDOW must equal NFFT.
%
%	[X] = AVGPERGM(x,NFFT,'frames') or [X] = AVGPERGM(x,
%	NFFT,WINDOW,'frames') returns a NFFT by L matrix where each
%	column in X is a single frame in the periodogram.  The
%	averaged periodogram is not returned.
%
%	[X,VAR] = AVGPERGM(x,NFFT,FRAME) computes the average,
%	overlapping periodogram (Welch procedure) of x.  The
%	frame length and percentage of overlap is specified in
%	the FRAME argument as a two-element vector of the
%	form [FRAMELENGTH OVERLAP] where FRAMELENGTH is the
%	frame length expressed in the number of samples-per-frame
%	(must be less-than or equal-to NFFT) and OVERLAP is the
%	percentage of overlap between succesive frames.  If OVERLAP
%	is not specified, zero overlap is used.  The overlap
%	must be specified in the range 0 <= OVERLAP < 100%.
%
%	[X,VAR] = AVGPERGM(x,NFFT,FRAME,WINDOW) uses the data smoothing
%	WINDOW.  The length of WINDOW must equal the frame length.
%
%	[X] = AVGPERGM(x,NFFT,FRAME,'frames') and
%	[X] = AVGPERGM(x,NFFT,FRAME,WINDOW,'frames') return the
%	individual frames vice the average.
